<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a cardiologist retired from clinical practice learning together with cardiology fellows, all aspects of the speciality of cardiology.</p>

<p>We have been using different modalities to help learn and teach about the circulatory system and disease that effect it. Most recently this has included mobile application based approached which I would like to expand to web based applications.</p>
